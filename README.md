# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! In this repo, I solve LeetCode problems organized by difficulty. Each problem's solution is implemented in Python, and the file names correspond to the problem's name on LeetCode for easy reference.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into three main folders based on problem difficulty:

- **Easy**: Beginner-level problems that typically require simple algorithms and logic.
- **Medium**: Intermediate-level problems that require more problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
- **Hard**: Advanced-level problems that may require complex algorithms, data structures, or optimizations.


Each file is named after the problem on LeetCode, for example:

```
Easy/Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String.py
Medium/Count and Say.py
Hard/Maximum Gap.py
```
